# Duplicates
Finding duplicates from a File and printing it to another file with duplicate count and creating another file with unique values.<br>

find all the duplicate lines and store the duplicate line as well as there count in the file duplicate.txt and then generate a new file "output.txt" which does not contain any repeating lines. <br>

For example: <br>
If the input file contains lines like <br>
```
abc
123
abc
xyz
dce
xyz
```
<br>
Your program should produce two files, namely: duplicate.txt with the following contents <br>

```
abc 2
xyz 2
```
<br>
And another file output.txt with the following contents: <br>

```
abc
123
xyz
dce
```
